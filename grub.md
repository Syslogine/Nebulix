### **Dual-Disk Partitioning for Legacy Systems**

Using an older system with GRUB installed on **Disk 1** (e.g., MBR bootloader) and the rest of the system's partitions (like `/`, `/home`, etc.) on **Disk 2** is possible, but there are specific considerations and configurations to keep in mind.

---

### **Potential Challenges**
1. **Dependency on Both Disks**:
   - Disk 1 must always be present and functional for the system to boot, even if Disk 2 contains the operating system.
   - If Disk 1 fails, you will need to repair or reinstall GRUB to boot again.

2. **Manual Partition Configuration**:
   - During installation, you must manually assign and configure partitions across the two disks.
   - The installer needs to know that `/boot` is on Disk 1 and everything else is on Disk 2.

3. **Performance**:
   - Ensure that both disks are reliable and connected to fast interfaces (e.g., SATA or NVMe). A slow Disk 1 can bottleneck the boot process.

### **Partition Layout Example**

#### Disk 1 (Boot Disk, MBR):
| Partition          | Size         | Purpose                                         | Notes                           |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `/boot`            | **1 GB**     | Bootloader files (non-encrypted).               | Stores GRUB, kernel, and initramfs. |

#### Disk 2 (Data Disk):
| Partition          | Size         | Purpose                                         | Notes                           |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `/`                | **30 GB**    | Root filesystem for the operating system.       | Houses system files and binaries. |
| `/home`            | **100 GB**   | Encrypted partition for user data.              | Documents, configurations, etc. |
| `/var`             | **10 GB**    | Encrypted partition for logs and variable files.| Keeps logs isolated and secure. |
| `/tmp`             | **5 GB**     | Encrypted partition for temporary files.        | Limits access to temporary files. |
| Swap               | Equal to RAM | Virtual memory (encrypted).                     | Supports hibernation if needed. |

### **Steps to Configure This Setup**
1. **Partition Disk 1 and Disk 2**:
   - During the Debian installation, select **Manual Partitioning**.
   - Assign the `/boot` partition to Disk 1.
   - Assign the other partitions (`/`, `/home`, etc.) to Disk 2.

2. **Install GRUB on Disk 1**:
   - When prompted during installation, select Disk 1 (e.g., `/dev/sda`) for GRUB installation.

3. **Encrypt Partitions on Disk 2**:
   - Use **LUKS** encryption for `/home`, `/var`, `/tmp`, and Swap during the installation process.
   - The root (`/`) partition can also be encrypted, but `/boot` cannot.

4. **Post-Installation Configuration**:
   - Ensure that `/etc/fstab` correctly references partitions from both disks.
   - If using LUKS, ensure the initramfs includes support for unlocking encrypted partitions:
     ```bash
     sudo update-initramfs -u
     ```

5. **Test Boot Process**:
   - Reboot the system and ensure GRUB loads correctly from Disk 1 and prompts for the LUKS passphrase to unlock Disk 2.

### **Considerations for Resilience**
- **Backup the MBR**:
  - If Disk 1 fails, you will lose GRUB. Backup the MBR so you can restore it:
    ```bash
    sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=mbr_backup.img bs=512 count=1
    ```
  - Store `mbr_backup.img` in a safe location.
  
- **Use Redundant Bootloaders**:
  - Install GRUB on both Disk 1 and Disk 2 as a fallback:
    ```bash
    sudo grub-install /dev/sda
    sudo grub-install /dev/sdb
    ```

- **Monitor Disk Health**:
  - Regularly check the health of both disks:
    ```bash
    sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda
    sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdb
    ```
