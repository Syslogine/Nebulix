# Using YubiKey as a Static Password Generator

Configure your **YubiKey** to generate a static password for secure logins or as an additional layer of authentication. A static password generated by the YubiKey acts like a very long, random password, making brute-force attacks nearly impossible.

---

## **Overview**

The YubiKey can:
- Store a static password in one of its slots.
- Automatically input the password when triggered, ensuring both convenience and security.

---

## **Prerequisites**

1. A **YubiKey 5 series** or later.
2. Installed tools:
   - `yubikey-manager` (for managing your YubiKey).

Install the tool on Linux:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install yubikey-manager
```

---

## **Step 1: Configure a Static Password**

1. **Plug in Your YubiKey**:
   Insert your YubiKey and verify it is detected:
   ```bash
   lsusb | grep Yubico
   ```

2. **Launch YubiKey Manager**:
   Open the YubiKey configuration tool:
   ```bash
   ykman otp static --generate 2
   ```

   - `--generate`: Generates a random static password.
   - `2`: Configures the second slot (Slot 2). Slot 1 is typically used for YubiKey OTP and should be left unchanged for compatibility.

3. **Test the Static Password**:
   - Open a text editor.
   - Press and hold the **YubiKey button** for a few seconds.
   - The static password should automatically appear in the text editor.

## **Step 2: Customize the Static Password**

You can also manually set a custom password instead of generating one:

1. Run the following command to set a custom password:
   ```bash
   ykman otp static --set-password 2
   ```

2. Enter your desired password when prompted. Choose a long, random password for maximum security.

---

## **Step 3: Use the Static Password**

1. **For Login or Authentication**:
   - Use the static password in combination with your regular password for services or systems that require enhanced security.

2. **For Password Manager**:
   - Configure the YubiKey to autofill the static password for logging into your password manager.

---

## **Step 4: Enhance Security**

### **1. Require Physical Touch**
Enable physical touch to prevent unauthorized use:
```bash
ykman otp set-touch --slot 2 on
```

### **2. Combine Static Password with Other Authentication Methods**
- Use the static password as part of a multi-factor authentication scheme for extra security.
- Example: Combine the static password with TOTP or WebAuthn.

---

## **Optional: Backup and Reset the YubiKey**

### **1. Backup the Static Password**
Manually record the static password in a secure location, such as an encrypted password manager.

### **2. Reset a Slot**
If you need to reset the YubiKeyâ€™s slot:
```bash
ykman otp delete 2
```
This will clear the static password from Slot 2.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### **1. YubiKey Not Recognized**
- Ensure the YubiKey is connected and detected:
  ```bash
  lsusb | grep Yubico
  ```

### **2. Static Password Not Working**
- Verify the correct slot is programmed.
- Reconfigure the YubiKey if needed.

### **3. Debugging Issues**
- Use the `ykman` tool with `--verbose` for more detailed logs:
  ```bash
  ykman otp static --generate 2 --verbose
  ```

## **Conclusion**

By configuring your YubiKey as a static password generator, you create a secure, tamper-resistant solution for authentication. Whether used for logins, password managers, or additional authentication layers, the static password functionality combines convenience with robust security.
