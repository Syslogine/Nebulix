# Securing SSH Keys with Encryption

Enhance the security of your **SSH keys** by encrypting them with a passphrase and employing additional layers of protection, such as hardware tokens, restricted agents, and key forwarding controls. This guide covers best practices and advanced techniques for protecting your SSH keys from unauthorized access.

---

## **Overview**

SSH keys are a critical component of secure server management. Encrypting and securing your keys ensures:
- **Confidentiality**: Protect private keys with strong encryption and passphrases.
- **Integrity**: Prevent unauthorized tampering or replacement.
- **Access Control**: Use hardware tokens and agent restrictions for enhanced security.

---

## **Prerequisites**

1. **SSH client tools** installed:
   - `openssh-client`
   - `ssh-keygen`
2. Familiarity with basic SSH concepts (e.g., public/private key pairs).

Install SSH tools if not already available:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-client
```

---

## **Step 1: Generate a New SSH Key Pair**

1. **Generate a New Key Pair**:
   Use `ssh-keygen` to create a key pair:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   - `-t rsa`: Specifies the key type (RSA).
   - `-b 4096`: Sets the key size (4096 bits recommended).
   - `-C`: Adds a comment for identification (e.g., email).

2. **Protect the Private Key with a Passphrase**:
   During the key creation process, you will be prompted to set a passphrase. Use a strong, memorable passphrase to encrypt the private key.

3. **Verify Key Pair**:
   - Private key: `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
   - Public key: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

---

## **Step 2: Encrypt an Existing SSH Key**

1. **Encrypt the Key**:
   If you have an unencrypted private key, encrypt it with a passphrase:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```
   - `-p`: Prompts for a new passphrase.
   - `-f`: Specifies the key file to update.

2. **Verify Encryption**:
   Check the private key file:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```
   The encrypted key should start with:
   ```plaintext
   -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
   ```

---

## **Step 3: Strengthen Key Encryption**

1. **Convert to Modern Format**:
   Convert older keys to a more secure format (if needed):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```
   - `-o`: Saves the key in the OpenSSH format.
   - `-a 100`: Specifies KDF (Key Derivation Function) rounds for added brute-force resistance.

2. **Enable Ed25519 Keys**:
   For modern cryptography, use Ed25519 keys:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

3. **Audit Key Strength**:
   Check your SSH key details:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

---

## **Step 4: Use a Hardware Token (Optional)**

1. **Store Keys on a YubiKey**:
   Use a YubiKey for hardware-backed SSH key storage:
   ```bash
   ykman ssh add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

2. **Test Authentication**:
   Insert the YubiKey and run:
   ```bash
   ssh-add -L
   ```

3. **Require Physical Touch**:
   Enable touch confirmation for each authentication attempt:
   ```bash
   ykman fido set-touch --key-slot=1 on
   ```

---

## **Step 5: Secure SSH Agent Usage**

1. **Use the SSH Agent**:
   Start the agent and add your key:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

2. **Restrict Agent Forwarding**:
   Avoid agent forwarding on untrusted systems. Disable forwarding in your `~/.ssh/config`:
   ```plaintext
   ForwardAgent no
   ```

3. **Set Agent Lifetime**:
   Automatically remove keys from the agent after a set time:
   ```bash
   ssh-add -t 3600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

---

## **Step 6: Configure Secure SSH Access**

1. **Edit SSH Configurations**:
   Add the following to your `~/.ssh/config` for secure connections:
   ```plaintext
   Host *
       AddKeysToAgent yes
       UseKeychain yes
       ForwardAgent no
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

2. **Restrict Key Use**:
   Limit SSH key usage to specific hosts:
   ```plaintext
   Host server.example.com
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

---

## **Step 7: Backup and Recover Keys**

1. **Backup SSH Keys**:
   Store a secure, encrypted backup of your keys:
   ```bash
   tar -czvf ssh_keys_backup.tar.gz ~/.ssh/
   gpg --encrypt --recipient your_email@example.com ssh_keys_backup.tar.gz
   ```

2. **Revoke a Key**:
   If a private key is compromised, remove its access:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -R hostname
   ```

---

## **Step 8: Advanced Security Measures**

### **1. Use Key Pinning**
Prevent MITM attacks by pinning SSH keys:
```bash
ssh-keyscan -H server.example.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

### **2. Enable FIDO2 Keys**
Generate and use FIDO2 keys for SSH:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -f ~/.ssh/id_fido
```

### **3. Rotate Keys Regularly**
Periodically generate new SSH key pairs and update servers:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@server
```

---

## **Step 9: Troubleshooting**

### **1. Key Not Found**
- Ensure the private key is in `~/.ssh/`.
- Add the key manually:
  ```bash
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```

### **2. Authentication Fails**
- Check server logs for errors:
  ```bash
  sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
  ```

### **3. Key Permissions Issue**
- Ensure proper permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```

## **Conclusion**

Encrypting and securing your SSH keys is essential for protecting your systems and data. By using strong passphrases, modern key types, and additional security layers like hardware tokens, you significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
